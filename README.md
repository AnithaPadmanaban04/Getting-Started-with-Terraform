# AWS Account:

# Step 2: Set Up Terraform and AWS CLI

* Install Terraform on your local machine if you haven't already. Follow the instructions from the [Terraform website]().
  
* [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your AWS credentials using aws configure command. You'll need your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, Region, and Output format.
